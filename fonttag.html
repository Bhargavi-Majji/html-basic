They are specified within the opening tag of an element and come in a name-value pair. Attributes like src for image sources, style for styling, and class for referencing CSS classes are commonly used.<br>
    </font><font color="fuchsia" face="impact" size="6">The HTML font tag is used to specify the font face, size, and color of text within an HTML document. It allows web developers to style text directly within the HTML, although it's now considered outdated and replaced by CSS. The face attribute specifies the font family, the size attribute controls the font size, and the color attribute sets the text color.
